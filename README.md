Anaconda distribution of Python is sufficient to run the main python notebook of the project (covid_19_project.ipynb), although the plotly library (plotly==4.14.3) 
might need to be installed. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

2. What are the COVID-19 mortality rate and the growth factor globally? 
3. Which are the top 20 countries in terms of confirmed cases, deaths, and mortality rate? 
4. What is the current epidemiological situation in the US?
